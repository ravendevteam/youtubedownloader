# Raven YouTube Downloader

Simple utility for bulk downloading YouTube videos.

It is not bound by the typical BSD-3 Clause license we typically use. If you do use this, no credit is needed.

## Features

- Input multiple URLs (one per line) to simultaneously download videos at once.
- Simple, lightweight, optimized, and no bloat. Very fast (assuming your internet connection is good).
- Idiot-proof. Checks URLs to ensure they are valid, and handles errors gracefully.
